# Art Museum Senior Project

This project is a social media chat application, intended to simulate the
interactions found in a physical art museum.

## Available Services

The project application comes equipped with these services to enhance the 
user experience:

### `Global Chat`

Talk to every user on the application!
Users are allowed to react to each other's messages with emojis, as well as
post them individually in the interface. Owned messages can also be edited
and deleted if need be.

### `Image Board`

The image board allows all users to post any images and videos of artistic
nature. This interface currently accepts .jpg/jpeg, png, .mp4 and .webm file
formats. Users are also able to react to each other's posts on the board.

### `Comment Sections/Threads`

In addition to the image board's functionalities, users may also set up
private threads under any post they desire. This allows for users
to have one-on-one conversations about a particular artpiece (Max 200 words
per message).
